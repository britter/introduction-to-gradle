# Introduction to Gradle

This is a sample repository for showing some of the feature of the [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org).
Review the history of this repository from the start to see the evolution of the build:

- Result of `gradle init`
- Adding a simple `zipSources` task
- Creating a custom `integrationTest` with custom source set
- Moving build logic to a separate build file
- Moving extracted build logic to a [precompiled script plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html#kotdsl:precompiled_plugins)
- Extracting build logic into plugin in `buildSrc`
- [Build Scans](https://docs.gradle.com/build-scan-plugin/)
